# Turn Google Sheets into a REST API and Use it with a React Application

React application to post form data to Google Sheets [build using this blog](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-and-googlesheets/).


For expanding this project:
- Add a homescreen with different categories cards - Groceries, procurement, etc.
- Each card opens a different react form and stores that value in their own spreadsheet. (procurement stores in procurement and groceries in groceries).
- See if it can be done in a single spreadsheet with different tabs.
- Use function components instead of class based ones.
- Make this a PWA -> https://blog.reactplay.io/building-a-progressive-web-application-pwa-using-react
- Use .env file to store API keys -> https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/gitignore-file-how-to-ignore-files-and-folders-in-git/

Note: UI could be a black background with gradient cards for each category.
